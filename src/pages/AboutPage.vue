      <h2>Welcome to Wolf Gear!</h2>
      <p>
        Founded on July 14, 2014, Wolf Gear began as a gathering of friends
        brought together by a shared vision: to strengthen their bond and
        collectively enhance their skills. What started as a small group has
        since evolved into a close-knit team of talented individuals, comprising
        Marco Aurélio, Matheus, Athos, Lucas, and Renato. While each member now
        pursues their respective careers as developers and audiovisual
        professionals, their friendship and commitment to personal growth remain
        at the core of Wolf Gear.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Wolf Gear, we believe that true success is not solely measured by
        individual achievements but by the strength of our relationships and
        collective progress. We recognize that when friends unite and support
        one another, their potential becomes limitless.
